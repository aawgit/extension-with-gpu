# rowser extension TODO: Change the name

This is based on the example project to show how to run ðŸ¤— Transformers in a browser extension.  https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js-examples.git
transformers.js-examples/browser-extension/

TODO:
 - Add a button instead of triggering from typing
 - Remove unncessary parts of the code
 - Refactor to appropriate files (background.js, popup.js)
 - Make sure models are loaded before user can triggers any action
 - Loading animation
 - May be load both models simultaniously
 - Create a minimalist boilerplate for this kind of extensions
