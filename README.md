# üìö Browser Extension to Select the Bookmark Folder
This is based on the example project to show how to run ü§ó Transformers in a browser extension.  https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js-examples.git
transformers.js-examples/browser-extension/

## üöÄ Features

- Runs a lightweight **transformers model** entirely in your browser (no backend needed!).
- **Analyzes** the web page and suggests a suitable **bookmark folder**.
- Allows users to **manually select** a folder if needed.
- **Lightweight, fast, and private** ‚Äî no server communication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Google Chrome** or **Chromium-based browsers** (tested on Chrome).
- **Chrome version 113 or newer** is recommended (for stable WebGPU support).
- **A GPU and support for WebGPU** This can be checked from here: [webgpureport](https://webgpureport.org/)

## üîß Browser Configuration

**Important:**  
This extension relies on **WebGPU** to run AI models efficiently inside the browser.  
You need to enable WebGPU manually:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to: `chrome://flags`
2. Search for **"Enable WebGPU"**.
3. Set it to **Enabled**.
4. Restart Chrome.

If you still encounter issues, try launching Chrome with the `--enable-unsafe-webgpu` flag (only if absolutely necessary).
